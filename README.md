# firstchapter
FirstChapter: 
Currently, my main focus is on the PHP language and the application of learned functionalities - CRUD, Login, Routes. Once I exhaust my knowledge in this language, I plan to continue with JavaScript, refactor functions, and, if possible, manually format using Bootstrap at the very end.

Long-term plan:
Once I completely finish this 'chapter,' I will create an entirely different project with an active API source.
The setup and configuration of docker-phpmyadmin-mysql are not mine. I utilize it from a completed course to ensure smooth development.
In the future, there are plans to complete additional courses: advanced PHP - Docker - Node.js - JS framework - PHP framework learning and working with them.
